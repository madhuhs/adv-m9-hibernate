Chapter 1: Introduction to Hibernate
============================================================

What is Hibernate?
------------------------------------------------------------
• Hibernate is an open-source Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for Java.
• Hibernate acts as a bridge between Java applications and the database, automatically converting
  object operations into SQL queries.
• It simplifies the process of building Java applications that interact with relational databases.
• By mapping Java classes to database tables, Hibernate handles the underlying SQL operations,
  helping developers to work directly with high-level Java objects.
------------------------------------------------------------
Why Use Hibernate?
------------------------------------------------------------
Hibernate addresses the limitations of traditional JDBC programming by offering the following advantages:

1. Ease of Use       : Hides the complexity of database operations, allowing developers to work with Java objects
                       instead of writing SQL queries.

2. Productivity      : Reduces repetitive boilerplate code, speeding up development.

3. Portability       : Works with multiple databases and makes switching between them easy.

4. Performance       : Provides built-in caching and optimization mechanisms.

5. Maintainability   : Database schema changes require minimal code modifications.

6. Scalability       : Efficiently handles large-scale, high-transaction applications.

These features help developers focus on business logic rather than database connectivity.

------------------------------------------------------------
How Hibernate Works Internally
------------------------------------------------------------
* Hibernate operates through configuration, mapping, and API layers that together manage communication
  between Java objects and the database.

1. Configuration Files:
   • Hibernate uses configuration files (usually hibernate.cfg.xml) to define database connection settings.
   • These include the database URL, username, password, JDBC driver class, and SQL dialect.
   • This enables Hibernate to communicate seamlessly with the database.

2. Mapping Files:
   • Mapping files (commonly .hbm.xml) or annotations define how Java objects map to database tables.
   • Each Java class corresponds to a specific table, and each data-member/filed maps to a column.
   • This process, called Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), removes the need for manual SQL handling.

3. Hibernate APIs:
   • Hibernate offers APIs to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
   • These APIs allow developers to interact with data using objects rather than SQL.

4. Transaction Management:
   • Hibernate ensures that groups of operations execute as a single unit of work.
   • This maintains data integrity — if one operation fails, the transaction rolls back.

5. Query Execution:
   • Queries can be executed using HQL (Hibernate Query Language), Criteria API, or native SQL.
   • HQL is object-oriented and works with Java entities instead of raw tables.

Key Components:
   - SessionFactory: Creates Session objects.
   - Session: Manages persistence and provides an interface between the app and the database.
   - Transaction: Handles commit and rollback operations.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. Features of Hibernate
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Automatic Table Creation: Can automatically generate tables from Java class structures.

2. Hibernate Query Language (HQL): Object-oriented query language similar to SQL but operates on entities.

3. Criteria Queries: Enables building dynamic queries programmatically.

4. Caching: Improves performance via first-level (Session) and second-level (SessionFactory) caches.

5. Lazy Loading: Fetches data only when needed, reducing initial load time.

6. Eager Loading: Fetches all related data immediately when required.

7. Transaction Management: Provides built-in commit and rollback support.

8. Automatic Dirty Checking: Detects and synchronizes object state changes automatically.

9. Association Mapping: Supports One-to-One, One-to-Many, and Many-to-Many relationships.

10. Database Independence: Works across multiple databases through dialect configuration.

5. JDBC vs Hibernate Comparison
------------------------------------------------------------
The following table highlights key differences between JDBC and Hibernate ORM:
