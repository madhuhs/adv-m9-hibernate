Chapter 10 : Connection Management

Working with databases in any application involves these steps:
	1.	Create a Connection
	2.	Perform DB Operations
	3.	Close / Destroy the Connection

* Creating and destroying database connections repeatedly
  is very expensive, especially in high-load applications / enterprise apps
* To improve performance, we use Connection Pooling.

* Connection Pooling will reuse database connections instead of creating new ones every time.

* Hibernate provides 3 ways to implement connection pooling:


1. Hibernate’s Default Connection Pooling

Hibernate has a built-in pooling mechanism using the internal class:

org.hibernate.engine.jdbc.connections.internal.DriverManagerConnectionProviderImpl

🔹 Features
	•	Default min connections = 1
	•	Default max connections = 20
	•	You can modify it using the property:

hibernate.connection.pool_size

* It is NOT recommended for production or real time application usage
* Only suitable for development/testing environments.


2. Third-Party Connection Management Libs(Static)

Hibernate supports several external connection pool libraries.
One of the most widely used is C3P0.

3. Application Server Provided Pooling (Dynamic)

(Like JBoss, WebLogic, WebSphere, Tomcat )

* Here the server maintains the pool, and Hibernate will fetch connections.
* Most efficient for large enterprise apps.
