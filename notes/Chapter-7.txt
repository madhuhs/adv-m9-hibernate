HQL (Hibernate Query Language)
	•	HQL is a query language similar to SQL but built for Hibernate.
	•	The query uses entity classes and fields and not tables/columns.

	•	Native SQL will tightly couple code to:
	•	table names
	•	column names
	•	If we rename a field or change mappings, SQL queries can break.

	•	Use objects to write queries in tables.
	•	Lets you write queries in terms of entities and fields:
	    Ex:
	*	FROM Movie m WHERE m.status = 'ACTIVE'
	*	FROM Show s WHERE s.movie.id = :movieId

	•	Hibernate translates HQL → SQL automatically based on mappings.
	•	Same HQL is database-independent works on MySQL, Postgres, etc.
	•	Works naturally with relations (@ManyToOne, @OneToMany, etc.).

Limitations
	•	String-based, so typing mistakes can create runtime errors.
	•	Not suitable for dynamic queries (optional filters).
	•	No direct support for DB-specific functions.
	•	Not ideal for very complex reporting SQL or performance tuning.



HQL Methods

HQL Query (org.hibernate.query.Query<T>)
	•	Created by session.createQuery(hql, Movie.class).

Important methods:
	•	setParameter(name, value) → bind named parameter.

	•	getResultList() → list of results.

	•	uniqueResult() → single result or null.

	•	setFirstResult(n) / setMaxResults(n) → pagination.

	•	executeUpdate() → for UPDATE / DELETE HQL.

HQL Example

List active movies:

String hql = "FROM Movie m WHERE m.status = 'ACTIVE'";
List<Movie> movies = session.createQuery(hql, Movie.class)
                            .getResultList();
