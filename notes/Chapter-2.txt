Chapter 2: Hibernate Features

============================================================
Key features and benefits.

Hibernate Features
1. Automatic Table Creation: Can automatically generate tables from Java class structures.

2. Hibernate Query Language (HQL): Object-oriented query language similar to SQL but operates on entities.

3. Criteria Queries: Enables building dynamic queries programmatically.

4. Caching: Improves performance via first-level (Session) and second-level (SessionFactory) caches.

5. Lazy Loading: Fetches data only when needed, reducing initial load time.

6. Eager Loading: Fetches all related data immediately when required.

7. Transaction Management: Provides built-in commit and rollback support.

8. Automatic Dirty Checking: Detects and synchronizes object state changes automatically.

9. Association Mapping: Supports One-to-One, One-to-Many, and Many-to-Many relationships.

10. Database Independence: Works across multiple databases through dialect configuration.
