6.	Mapping Concepts

OneToOne : Its a type assc. where for every record of left table
           there exists exactly one record in the right table.

           The assc. is managed by using FK.

           OneToOne mapping can be of 2 types
           1.uni-directional mapping
           2.bi-directional mapping

           * In a one-to-one uni-directional mapping, one entity has a reference to another entity,
             and the association is only navigable in one direction.

           * In a one-to-one bi-directional mapping, both entities have references to each other,
             and the association is navigable in both directions.

* Steps to achieve uni-directional OneToOne-mapping

  Step1 : Create entity classes using @Entity and @Table
  Step2 : Create columns using @Column and @Id
  Step3 : Create a global-non-static-reference variable of the associated class
  Step4 : Use @OneToOne annotation on global-non-static-reference variable to mark the type of Assc.
  Step5 : Use @JoinColumn on global-non-static-reference variable to mark the FK.
  Step6 : Use <mapping> tag and specify mappings in hibernate.cfg.xml


  For @OneToOne relation specify cascade as cascade = CascadeType.ALL.

    cascade = CascadeType.ALL :
    This will ensure that all DML operations insert,update and delete will
    be applicable on Associated table as well

* Steps to achieve bi-directional OneToOne-mapping

  Step1 : Create entity classes using @Entity and @Table
  Step2 : Create columns using @Column and @Id
  Step3 : Create a global-non-static-reference variable of the associated class
  Step4 : Use @OneToOne annotation on global-non-static-reference variable to mark the type of Assc.
  Step5 : Use @JoinColumn on global-non-static-reference variable to mark the FK.
  Step6 : On the Ascc. table create a global-non-static-reference variable of the owner class
  Step7 : Use @OneToOne annotation on global-non-static-reference variable and use mappedBy = "refvar"
  Step8 : Use <mapping> tag and specify mappings in hibernate.cfg.xml

OneToMany : Its a type assc. where for every record of left table
           there exists one or more records in the right table.


           orphanRemoval = true -> unlink the relation and remove
                                   the record from child table
